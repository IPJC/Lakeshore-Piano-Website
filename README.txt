## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

I hope to add more pages for contact and events. I would also like to add a data cache and a tab image gallery for the reviews. 

## Lessons Learned:

As one of my first projects, this site helped me gain a deeper understanding of CSS as well hosting sites on netlify.
